# Token Ring Network Simulation
* This project is a simulation of a Token Ring network consisting of 10 computers. Message transmission in this network involves the existence of a unique token that moves through the communication medium from computer to computer in a single direction.
## Description
- For each computer, a buffer and an IP address are simulated, used in the process of message transmission.
- The token is characterized by the source computer's IP address, destination computer's IP address, message content, a field indicating whether the token is free or occupied, and a field indicating whether the token has reached its destination or not.
- At each step of the simulation, a source and a destination for the message are randomly generated, and the token is taken by the corresponding source computer and transmitted through the network.
### You can clone the repository to your local machine, assure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed and just open the .sln ; This project was made for a simulation of a token ring network of 10 computers for primitive demonstration of this example.
